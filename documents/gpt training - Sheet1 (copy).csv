"A physical or tangible entity/item which is sold by a company to their customers is termed as a product. However, in the subscription industry, a product is more of an intangible service that a company offers to their customers. A customer in the subscription industry is typically subscribed to a product on a recurring pay basis rather than buying it at a onetime price. The internet connection and the telephone connection in our houses are the best examples of a product in the subscription industry. Users pay for the aforementioned products as they use on a monthly and on a recurring basis. A product in OneBill application, much like the above scenario is yet another item/service along with other data such as charge details, price plans, and other similar parameters. A product in the OneBill application can have various Price Plans. The Price Plans, in turn, flaunt several charge details which basically describe how a customer will be charged. The Price Plan along with its charge details together defines and describes what a product in OneBill really is. The list of all the products along with their details are present in the Product Catalog as explained in the section below. Customers are subscribed to these products as per their requirement"
"A product catalog is basically a collection of all of the products that a business has to offer to their subscribers; listed together in an order along with its other necessary details such as price plan, charge details, Add-ons, category, and the status of the product. A collection of several products is known as a Bundle. In this section, you will learn how the product catalog is built for your business. The different components of the product catalog have been detailed below as follows: Product: Product is any physical good or a service that you provide to your end subscribers.
Price Plan: Price plans are the different flavors/plans offered to buy a product. Price plan can include
one or more charges that are applied when a subscriber buys a product/service. Each product can have
one or more price plans.
Price plan charge: Each price plan can have one or more charges defined in it. Charges can be onetime like a purchase fee, recurring like a monthly subscription charge or a metered fee like a fixed fee
for every movie view.
A business needs to set-up products in the system before they can sign up subscribers. You can create any
number of products for the product catalog and associate a wide range of price plans and charges to each
product. Refer to Create a new product; Create a Price Plan for the Product and Define Charge Details.
These simplified configuration features enable rapid time to market and the ability to adjust your product
offerings to your subscriber and market needs."

"This checkbox can be set at the price plan if the business intends to override the price of the plan for every customer that they sell to. Setting this checkbox would enable a business to override the price at the time of placing an order. Refer the order flow to know how to handle price override during an order Priority- This option is included for the price plans which has Metered Charges. When a subscription includes Base and Add-on Products, defining the priority for such price plan ensures the higher order of rating at the time of CDR imports in OneBill, Higher the number, higher the priority. For example: For a subscription which has a Base price plan and an Add-on price plan, the priority definition will work in following ways: The Price plans should have metered charges to define the priority. In the case of New age Rating, with multiple charge groups and multiple UOMs, the priority will work only if UOM of the add-on charge group matches with the base product charge group. Once, the UOM matches, the higher priority will be given to the higher number defined for the price plan. For example, if the priority is defined as 2 for Add-on and 1 for the Base product.The Add-on price plan precedes the base price plan during CDR rating. In the case of same priority defined for both, base product as well as an add-on product, the priority will be given to the Base product. Price Plan Code- Enter a code representing the Price Plan of the product for its unique identification. You can enter maximum 64 characters including special characters.

setup the services chosen by subscribers. In OneBill, we have defined such products as
Feature Based Products. Provisioning is mandatory for Feature-Based products. For detailed
steps of entering Provisioning details for feature-based products, refer “Define Provisioning
parameters”.
Advance Charges- This option enables the business to apply charges well ahead in time, i.e.
before the normal billing cycle of a product with recurring monthly charges. Based on the
number of Months entered next to Advance Charges, the price plan charges will be applied to
the subscriber’s account in advance during each billing cycle. Currently, the system supports
advance charges for 1 and 2 months only. The default value is set as 1.
For example, If the Months for Advance charges has been selected as 2 and the billing is
scheduled for the month of March, the advance charges will be applied in the month of
January i.e. 2 months ahead of the billing period. Or if the default value 1 is selected, the
charges will be applied in February for the same product.
NoteAdvance Charges will only apply on Recurring Monthly Charges.
As of now, the system allows you to select only two values for the Months in advance i.e. 1
and 2.
The default value is 1.

the time of purchase. By default, this option will be disabled. This flag would only be displayed

"Metered charges are applied based on the service utilization by subscribers. For example, a subscriber has purchased a telecom product and he/she uses some units of voice calls and data packages offered in the product. After initializing the service, the subscriber would be charged for all the voice calls made or data downloaded in his device/system during his/her billing period. At the end of the billing period, the customer will be billed for the total number of units used. Rating can be defined based on beats i.e. units consumed by the subscriber. A unit price is defined to calculate the metered charge for a product/service utilization, For example, call per minute, or per second, data download per MB, etc. Let's take an example: If a telecom product/service offers a normal fixed charge of $0.5/minute for a voice call. it offers a minimum fixed charge $1 for first two minutes after that, every minute will be charged at normal rate of $0.5/min. Hence, for a 5 minutes voice call, there are 3 increments during a call usage, therefore the subscriber will be charged $2.5. Here, if the call usage is only 50 seconds, the subscriber will be charged $1 as minimum charge applicable."
"To define a metered charge follow these steps: 1. Navigate to Pricing Studio -> Products and click on Create New Product 2. Add Price Plan as explained in Add new Price Plan section 3. Scroll down to the Charge details section of the price plan.

"The following fields are defined in a separate section below above-mentioned fields. This section is specific to Metered Charge Definition: Charge - Enter the charge amount for the unit entered in next field. For example, you can define a

the unit should be 60 for a charge amount of $0.5.
Minimum- The number of units offered at a fixed charge. The ""minimum value"" you enter in Metered

of 60 seconds will mean every call will be charged for at least 60 seconds with defined rate per units.
Increment- The no. of increased units after consuming minimum units. You can define the maximum
no. of units to be charged as defined in the charge field. for example, If you have defined 60 seconds
of units as Increment, then In a 300-second voice call, there are 3 increments of 60 seconds each
after consuming minimum no. of units i.e.120 seconds.

A business user can create an ad-hoc charge for any specific purpose under Charge definition during price plan creation. OneBill allows you to not only create ad-hoc charge but also give it a name as per its requirement in the price plan; that is why we also call it flexi-charges.

Total Term - Indicates the predefined ""Term"" for which the subscription was purchased, e.g. 12 Months, 6
Months, etc.
Remaining Term - Indicates the remaining term of the subscription after it is canceled. It gets effective
from the cancellation date. For example, If a subscription with 12 months of Term, gets canceled after 8
months, then the remaining term will be 4 months.
Used Term - Indicates the Term used for the subscription till the date when the subscription was canceled.
For example, If a subscription with 12 months of Term, gets canceled after 8 months, then the Used term
will be 8 months.
Attributes for Then Operator:
The following choices are available to apply rule-based cancellation charge:
-Remaining Term Unit Price
-Unit price
- Final Price
Remaining Term Unit Price -> Calculates the cycle fee setup in the rule to apply the charges on
cancellation If this option is selected then charges will be calculated and applied according to the following formula:
Remaining Term * quantity * price defined in the rule
For example: If a subscription with 2 Quantity and 12 months of term gets canceled after 8 months, and
remaining term unit price is set as $10 in the rule, then the charge applied to the remaining term will be:
4* 2*10 = $80
Important to Know:
If the Remaining Term option is selected for a rule and is associated with a subscription(price plan)
which doesn't have Term then remaining term will be considered as 1.
This option is available only for cancellation charge rules.
Note: Even though these three options are available for non-cancellation charges rules, these attributes
should not be used. If these are used for non-cancellation charges rules then those conditions evaluate to
false.
Unit Price - Indicates a fixed unit charge to be applied on Cancellation. In this case, the cancellation
charge is calculated as quantity * price. For example, If a subscription with 2 quantity has a $10 price then
the unit price will be calculated as $20.
Final Price - Indicates a fixed total price of the subscription. This option does not consider the quantity for
calculating the cancellation charges.
Note- You can apply cancellation charge for future dated cancellations as well.
Eg: Subscription is purchased on Jan1st 2015 with 12 months term with 2 quantities and if this
subscription is getting canceled with an effective date as May 15th, 2015 then the above variables values
will be calculated as:
Total term = 12
Remaining Term = 7.55
Used Term = 4.45
For this scenario, a rule can be defined as: As per the rule definition cancellation charge will be 7.55 * 2 * 0.5 = $7.55
The system will apply this rule based charge on the subscription for the cancellation before completing its
term."
"Business may need to apply specific charges to a subscription at the time of bill finalization, this can be done by setting up Bill time Charge. Bill Time charge can be applied by associating counters to a price plan. It captures the counter value after rating/counting the events using the counter associated with the price plan.

"A suspension charge is an amount which is charged by a provider to a subscriber, due to the suspension of a subscription for a specific period. The suspension charge needs to be defined as an additional charge type while defining a product in the OneBill application. This charge must be associated with a price plan in the product."
"In order to set-up the suspension charge in the OneBill application, the user must perform the following actions: 1. Navigation: The user must first navigate to the suspension charge option. Click on the Products option under the Pricing Studio menu in the left panel. The product listing page appears. 2. Click on the Create Product button. The create new product page will appear.

itself accordingly. A set of new fields corresponding to Suspension Charge appear. "
"What are the conditions to set-up the suspension charge? The suspension charge type is added to a price plan while creating a product. However, there are a few restrictions to it as well. Following are a few of the conditions which must be met in order to successfully set-up the suspension charge: 1. A suspension charge is applicable only if there is a Recurring Charge associated with the same price plan. 2. A suspension charge cannot be defined in a product price plan if the price plan contains another feature based charging. 3. The Suspension Charge is a rule-based charge. What would happen if there is no recurring charge type in the price plan? If there is no Recurring Charge type in the price plan, the system would allow the user to create a suspension charge along with the product without any error. However, the suspension charge will not be applied in the case of the suspension of the subscription. What would happen if the user adds a feature based charge to the price plan? In this case, the user won't be able to create the product and the OneBill application will display an error. What if the user does not want to refund upon suspension or charge the subscriber upon resume? The CHARGE_DURING_SUSPEND_OR_RESUME is a configuration parameter and is used to determine the refund and charging possibilities upon the suspension of a subscriber's subscription. There are two scenarios which are possible in a case when a subscriber's subscription is suspended. Each of the corresponding scenarios has been explained below with appropriate examples. Case 1: CHARGE_DURING_SUSPEND_OR_RESUME is set to ENABLED. In this case, let us assume that the subscriber's subscription is suspended on the 21st of May. Let us say that the billing day of the month is the 1st. After the subscription is suspended, the subscriber will be refunded the prorated amount from 21st May to the 31st of May. If the subscriber wishes to resume the subscription on the 25th, then the subscriber will be charged from the 25th to the 31st of May.
Case 3: CHARGE_DURING_SUSPEND_OR_RESUME is set to DISABLED. In this case, let us assume that
the subscriber's subscription is suspended on the 21st of May. Let us say that the billing day of the month
is the 1st. So, on the first of June, the suspension charges will be applied. After the subscription is
suspended, we're considering that the subscription was resumed on the 15th of June. In such a scenario,
the subscriber will not be refunded any amount."

"Add on Products are extension of base products.

For example, If you have created a Base product of “VOIP Services” in product catalog (See: Create Product), you can also create an Add-on Product of “VOIP Add-on Cards” to complement the services of VOIP product. (See: Create Add-on Product) Add-on lets a business customize their product offerings and add extra capabilities/features with a small change pricing. Subscriber has to pay only for what he gets. it gives flexibility to end subscribers to purchase or add the additional features (we call it Add-On)when they need it with base product creating a win-win situation for both, business as well as subscriber. For example, After subscribing to the base product and add-on product, subscriber can cancel or extend the add-on subscription while his/her base product subscription still continues.

Offer more capability, features and variety along with your base product
Provide additional features or plugins which works best with your base product

"A business user can define a Service to map the product sold to a downstream service provisioning. The Service definition works along with the provisioning parameter definition under a plan, and the OneBill provisioning module to map the sale of a product to the downstream provisioning. For eg for a user purchasing a HostedPBX, the Service can help setup the users/extensions on the soft-switch as part of the purchase. A Service can be linked to one or more product. That way a common provisioning definition can be used across products. The default view of the service screen shows the service listing as shown below. "
